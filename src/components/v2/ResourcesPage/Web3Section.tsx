      Blockchain networks like XDC Network can be used to support a decentralized
      Web3 — the next generation of internet. Web3 is most simply described as
      hosting applications, storing and accessing private data, and transferring
      value, content, and ideas using completely decentralized networks with no
      single point of failure and no trust required. Goodbye centralized,
      privately owned servers. Open-source trustless systems will remain more
      stable and reliable than centralized servers due to the network being
      maintained by hundreds or even thousands of entities instead of just one.
