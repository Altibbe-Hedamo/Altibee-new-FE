      The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) acts as a virtual computer or processor
      for the Ethereum blockchain. As transactions and functions are executed,
      the EVM translates data and information for processing. If a blockchain is
      EVM compatible, it simply means that it uses the same tech stack and tools
      as Ethereum and other EVM compatible networks. XDC Network is fully
      EVM-compatible.
